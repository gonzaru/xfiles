.Sh USAGE
.Nm xfiles
is controlled mainly with the mouse,
but some actions can also be performed with the keyboard.
.Pp
.Nm xfiles
has four modes of operation.
In each mode, some mouse or keyboard actions are allowed while others are not.
The modes of operation are as follows.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Normal Mode
This is the mode which
.Nm xfiles
starts in.
All actions, except rectangular selection and scroller manipulation,
can be performed while in this mode.
All other modes are accessible from the normal mode.
.It Selection Mode
This mode is entered after dragging the pointer with the first button in normal mode.
In this mode, a rectangle can be drawn, in which any file inside it can be selected.
No action other than the rectangular selection can be performed while in this mode.
To exit this mode, release the first mouse button.
.It Scroll Mode
This mode is entered after opening the scroller with the second button in normal mode.
In this mode, the file list can be scrolled up and down by moving the mouse.
No action other than scrolling can be performed while in this mode.
To exit this mode, press the second mouse button
(or release it, if the pointer had not been released nor moved outside the scroller).
.It Waiting Mode
This mode is entered after
.Nm xfilesctl
is called (such as after pressing the third mouse button or dropping a file).
In this mode,
.Nm xfiles
is waiting for
.Nm xfilesctl
to exit.
No action can be performed while in this mode.
To exit this mode,
.Nm xfilesctl
must return.
.El
.Ss Mouse button 1
The first mouse button (usually the left one) is used for selection and opening.
Selecting one or more files copies their paths into the PRIMARY X selection.
Opening a single file invokes the command specified by the
.Ev OPENER
environment variable with the path to the open file as argument.
The
.Ev OPENER
program is invoked in the directory currently open at
.Nm .
.Bl -bullet -width 2
.It
A single click with no modifier on a file's icon selects it (deselecting any other file).
.It
A double click with no modifier selects and opens it (deselecting any other file).
.It
A single click with a Control modifier does not deselect previously selected files,
but adds the clicked file to the selection list instead.
.It
A single click with a Shift modifier adds to the selection list any file between
the previously selected one and the clicked one.
.It
A dragging motion on no file with no modifier
draws a rectangle selecting anything inside it (deselecting any other file).
.It
A dragging motion on no file with either the Control or Shift modifiers
draws a rectangle adding to the selection list anything inside it.
.It
A dragging motion on a file initiates a drag-and-drop operation with the selected files.
The dragged files can be then dropped on a directory on the current
.Nm xfiles
window, or on another window supporting the XDND protocol.
The dragging motion can be modified by
Control (forcing a copy operation);
Shift (forcing a move operation); or
Control + Shift (forcing a symbolik linking operation);
.El
.Ss Mouse button 2, 4, and 5
The second, fourth and fifth buttons (the middle button click, scroll up and scroll down)
are used for scrolling.  No modifier applies to those buttons.
The second button pops up the scroller.

.Nm ;
it can be used either as a scrollbar or as Firefox's autoScroll.
.Bl -bullet -width 2
.It
A press on the second button pops up the scroller.
Moving the pointer up or down scrolls the list of files up or down.
If the button is release while the pointer is outside the scroller, the scroller is closed.
.It
After pressing the second button (as in the previous bullet item),
if it is released while the pointer is inside the scroller, the scroller is not closed.
The scroller handle (a small bar inside the scroller) can be dragged up and down,
scrolling the list of files up or down.
Pressing any button closes the scroller.
.It
Holding the fourth button scrolls the list of files up.
.It
Holding the fifth button scrolls the list of files down.

with no argument.
