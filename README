                       XFiles: a X11 File Manager
                 <https://github.com/phillbush/xfiles>

Features:
• Icons representing directory entries.
• Icon view only (list/culumn/tree/etc view is not and will not be implemented).
• Uncluttered interface (no toolbar, sidebar, etc but grid of icons).
• Mouse interaction with drag-and-drop and selection actions.
• Drag-and-drop within the same XFiles window.
• Drag-and-drop between two XFiles windows.
• Drag-and-drop between an XFiles window and another application.
• Scroller widget (activated on middle mouse button) replacing scrollbars.
• XEmbed support, to incorporate other application's windows as widgets
  (for example, dmenu can be used as an address bar).
• File operations are delegated to a user-written script (xfilesctl).
• Thumbnail (64x64 PPM image) generation delegated to a script (xfilesthumb).
• Appearance (like colors and font) customizable by X resources.

See ./demo.png for a illustration of XFiles in action.


§ INSTALLATION

Build XFiles with “make”.
Copy the built binary file ./xfiles into your system's $PATH.
Optionally, copy the manual file `./xfiles.1` in your system's $MANPATH.
Optionally, copy the scripts in ./examples/ in your system's $PATH.

Dependencies:
• C99 compiler, for building.
• POSIX make, for building.
• Mandoc, for the manual.
• POSIX C standard library and headers.
• X11 libraries and headers (Xlib, Xcursor, Xext, Xft, Xpm, Xrender).
• Fontconfig library and headers.
• Pthreads library and headers.
• (NOTE: The xfilesctl and xfilesthumb scripts may depend on other programs).


§ QUICK-START

Context menu.
XFiles has no context menu; but it invokes “xfilesctl” at right-click.
You can make a xfilesctl script open xmenu(1) or other pop-up menu program.
On right-click, it is invoked as follows (%s is the paths to selected files):

	xfilesctl menu %s

Address bar.
XFiles has no address bar; but it invokes “xfilesctl” at Ctrl+key presses.
You can make a xfilesctl script open dmenu(1) or other prompt program.
On, say, Ctrl+L, it is invoked as follows (%s is the paths to selected files):

	xfilesctl ^L %s

File operations.
XFiles does no file operation; but it invokes “xfilesctl” at icon manipulation.
You can make a xfilesctl script call cp(1) or other command on a drop action.
On file dropping, it is invoked as follows (%s is the path to selected files):

	xfilesctl drop-ask %s

Thumbnails.
XFiles does not generate thumbnails; but it invokes “xfilesthumb” to do so.
Thumbnails must be 64x64 pixels in size, and must be in the PPM format.
You can make a xfilesthumb script call pdftoppm(1) to create a pdf thumbnail.
The xfilesthumb script is invoked as follows:

	xfilesthumb /path/to/file /path/to/miniature.ppm

Examples.
See the ./examples/ directories for script and configuration examples:
• ./examples/xfilesctl (example controller script).
• ./examples/xfilesthumb (example thumbnailer script).
• ./examples/Xresources (example X resources database).

Read the manual at ./xfiles.1 for more information on usage.
