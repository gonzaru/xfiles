            TODOs, FIXMEs, XXXs, and general notes and ideas

§ Split ./examples/xfilesctl into a few scripts

Splits the example file for XFiles' controlling script into a few
scripts.  The provided example does too much file operations, some
of which could rather be performed by a separate independent utility.

The following example scripts should be created:
• ./examples/trash: Send files to XDG trash.
• ./examples/untrash: Send files from XDG trash to original directory.
• ./examples/rmtrash: Clean trash.
• ./examples/rename: Bulk file renaming.


§ Keep item selected by name when refreshing directory

When refreshing the directory (such as when a file was changed, removed
or created), keep selected the file with the same name as the one which
was selected before refresh (which is not necessarily the same file, as
it may have been truncated and/or recreated).

Currently, the file at the same position in the sort list is selected
after refresh.


§ Handle clipboard selection

Handle the CLIPBOARD selection directly in <./widget.c>, and call
xfilesctl with converted selection content when pasting from clipboard
(Ctrl-V).

Currently, the content of the CLIPBOARD selection is set and fetched by
the xfilesctl script by calling xclip(1) or a similar utility.  It
should just handle a list of path pre-processed by XFiles.


§ Write progress dialog/indicator program

Write program (for xfilesctl to fork) to show progress of ongoing file
operations.


§ Early drag-and-drop return

Check the return of ctrldnd(3)'s callback function to cancel the ongoing
drag-and-drop, so the ctrldnd_drag() and ctrldnd_getdrop() functions
return immediately.


§ Support XDND-based protocols

Support additional protocols built on top of XDND:
• Direct Save Protocol <https://johnlindal.wixsite.com/xdsave>.
• Search Parameter Sharing Protocol <https://johnlindal.wixsite.com/xsearch>.


§ Support hostnames in URI list

Support drops in text/uri-list target that contains hostnames in URIs.
Also, fetch the hostname of machine XFiles is running on.

Currently, XFiles only supports URIs in "file:///path/to/file" format;
but not in "file://example.host/path/to/file".

XFiles MUST NOT include the hostname in the URIs when dragging a file
from a XFiles window.  It must only support URIs with hostnames when
dropping from another application.

See <https://edeproject.org/spec/file-uri-spec.txt> (site does not
exist, use Web Archive).


§ Support malformed URIs

Currently, a drop in "text/uri-list" target must be a sequence of
"file:///path/to/file\r\n" strings.  Add support for the following
deviations:
• "file://example.host/path/to/file\r\n".  See <§ Support hostnames
  in URI list> above.
• "/path/to/file\r\n" (no scheme).
• "file:///path/to/file\n" (no CRLF).
• "file:///path/to/file" (no CRLF or LF delimiter).  Consider it a
  URI list with a single URI.
• Any combination of the above.


§ Support XdndUriList as an alternative to text/uri-list target.

Use "XdndUriList" target if provided, as an alternative to "text/uri-list"
target.


§ Conditionally decide the target of the drop

Decide the target to get drop as AFTER we get the list of targets the
drop is provided as.

Currently, ctrldnd_getdrop() is passed an array of targets the caller
wants the drop as.  That function requests the drop in the first target
in the array which the drop can be converted to.  The caller has no
opportunity to decide which target to use from the provided ones.

The caller of ctrldnd_getdrop() should be able to decide the target to
use in order to implement the feature <§ Drop whole file content?> below.


§ Add hacking information

Write on how one can understand the code and contribute to it.
That includes:
• Creating a <./HACKING> text file.
• Adding a short header on each C file describing the module.


§ Add third argument to xfilesthumb

Add a third (optional) argument to xfiles thumb specifying the maximum
width and height of the thumbnail to be generated.

xfilesthumb must then be called as follows:

	xfilesthumb /path/to/file /path/to/miniature.ppm 64


§ Disentangle XFiles-specific code from widget

Remove code relating to file-browsing from the <./widget.c> module.

The idea is to make <.widget.c> into a generic icon-grid widget to use
in, for example, a thumbnail listing of a image viewer, an icon theme
viewer, etc.

It would then be moved to the <./control/> directory, which I want to
make into a utility library for my X applications.


§ Implement support for editres protocol

Implement editres protocol for exporting resources at runtime.

It should be able for editres(1) (or a similar program I want to write)
to show and edit the resources a particular instance of XFiles is using
without needing to change X server's global resources.

See also:
• <./comm.c> at editres(1) source.
• <./EditresCom.c> at xmu(3) source.
• <https://flippery.org/gtk_editres>


§ Handle X protocol errors

Set an error handler callback to handle non-fatal X protocol errors.
That should be similar to what is done at <./control/dragndrop.c>.


§ Drag whole file content(?)

(I am not sure whether this should be implemented.)

When dragging, provide the content of the dragged file as an additional
target.  This would impose the following conditions:
• Content can only be dropped when dragging a single file.
• Content can only be dropped when file is small enough (< 512 KB).
• Content should be provided as a MIME type.
• libmagic should be added as dependency to guess content's MIME type.

XFiles supplies dragged files into three targets (a "target" is a format
of data of an X selection): "text/uri-list", "STRING" and "UTF8_STRING".
The data in all those targets is just the plain (UTF8-encoded) absolute
paths of the dragged files, not their content (files are not even opened
or read).  The first target is a sequence of percent-encoded URIs; and
the other two are just sequence of plain paths.

The feature <§ Conditionally decide the target of the drop> must be granted
in order to implement this one.


§ Drop octet stream(?)

(I am not sure whether this should be implemented.)

When dropping, save drop data as a new file in current directory.  Or
prompt user whether/how to save.

The following conditions must be true:
• Drop is supplied as raw bytes ("application/octet-stream" target).
• Drop is not supplied as a URI list ("text/uri-list" target); or it
  lists a single unsupported URI.

A URI is unsupported if it is in an unknown scheme (like "https://") or
it is a "file://" URI on a remote host.  (We do not check for host).
Optionally, derive filename for the saved file from URI.


§ Demo animation(?)

(I am not sure whether this should be implemented.)

Replace <./demo.png> with a series of animated gifs (with predefined,
restricted palette) demonstrating particular GUI interactions:
• Performing rectangular selection with pointer.
• Performing drag-and-drop (drop video from XFiles into MPV).
• Controlling the scroller widget.
• Spawning a context-menu.
• Spawning a embedded XTerm window (with XEmbed).
• Comparing a window without thumbnails and a window with thumbnails.


§ Redo command-line interface(?)

(I am not sure whether this should be implemented.)

Use X11-style flags (foo -bar -baz) rather than UNIX-style flags
(foo -r -z).


§ Implement input translation X resources(?)

(I am not sure whether this should be implemented.)

Add X resources for rebind hardcoded XFiles keyboard commands, which are
not handled by the xfilesctl(1) script.  That will use something similar
to translation resources from Xaw(3).

If implemented, I will likely remove vi HJKL hardcoded keyboard commands.


§ Use XDG thumbnail spec(?)

(I am not sure whether this should be implemented.)

Use XDG specification for caching and saving thumbnails, so them can be
shared between different file managers.  That requires using libpng(3)
as an additional dependency.


§ Write configure script(?)

(I am not sure whether this should be implemented.)

Write a <./configure> script to check host system before building.  It
should generate a <./config.mk> file that will be included by Makefile.
